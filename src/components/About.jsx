        <h2>About Iron-Fists</h2>
        <p>
          Iron-Fists is a UK based clan that takes a semi-professional approach to operations. We like a challenge, often playing way
          out-numbered and out-gunned. We use ACE3, 3CB, RHS, CUP Maps and TFAR. We run three members nights a week and two public
          servers.
