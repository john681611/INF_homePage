        <h2>About Iron-Fists</h2>
        <p>
          Iron-Fists is a UK based ArmA clan that takes a semi-professional
          approach to operations. We like a challenge, often playing way
          out-numbered and out-gunned. Our Primary focus is Arma Reforger
          although we still regularly play ArmA 3 and other games as a clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Major Decisions are put to a squad vote. All members are listened
          to rank is only used for tie breakers and mission command structure.
