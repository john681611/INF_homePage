		"text": "In 2020 the world saw a miraculous change in political tensions following the “Bering Strait” incident. The USS Gerald R Ford and its escort ships were heavily damaged in the first attempt by a main force fleet to navigate the arctic. With the fleet flag ship on the verge of sinking, a general SOS was broadcast. The only ships for 300 miles were part of a Chinese/Russian joint exercise and, in an unexpected turn, immediately vectored north. Using the emergency diplomatic line set up between Washington and Moscow in 2014 the Russian and Chinese vessels were allowed access to the US fleet with some of the most courageous seamanship seen in recent years; all three nations battled for six hours to save lives and ships. The Gerald R Ford was scuttled with only the loss of 23 of her crew yet the combined efforts of all remaining vessels meant that no other ships were lost with four US ships being towed to Ports in Alaska by Russian and Chinese ships. \r\n\r\nAt an emergency UN security council meeting all member states were unanimous in their praising of all nations and personal involved in the incident, using it as a stepping stone for future co-operation. The US pulled its opposition to the Syrian Regime with the Russians and Chinese cutting all existing ties with North Korea forcing them to the negotiating table. With the cooling of tensions across the globe most nations were able to turn their attention back to counter terror operations.\r\n",
